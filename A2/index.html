According to Soy (2020), Africa's case-fatality ratio (CFR) is lower than the global CFR. The <b>Americas</b> have more countries with <b>higher death-recovery ratios</b>. The rest of the continents <b>average</b> around <b>1k deaths and 10k recoveries</b>. With decreased social gatherings and more precautions taken, hopefully the countries can stay in higher positions in recoveries (nearer to the top) and lower positions in deaths (nearer to the left).</p>

                    <p>The line graph on the right is divided into two parts: one for categoric cases and the other for number of countries.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>The graph of categoric cases is a clear picture of how the outbreak escalated. Up until 20th <b>March</b>, the line stays <b>low</b> as the rise in cases was steady.</p>
                    <p>Subsequently, the line graph increases exponentially. The <b>virus aggressively spread</b> out in such a short time. On the bright side, recoveries soar relatively higher than deaths and active cases mostly due to precautions taken and intensive medical assistance.</p>
                    <p>We can see that the number of countries infected were small up until around March. Most of the countries became infected from there onwards.</p>
                    <p>IsGlobal (2020) states that its main tranmission path is by the air. Many countries contracted the virus because of travels and movements which were too late to stop in the early stages.</p>
                    <p>However, with more awareness and decreased outdoor activities, deaths and active cases were kept on a slow increase.</p>

                    <p>Compared to recoveries, a smaller area covered in the graph of deaths per 100 cases is good news. The area for deaths per 100 recoveries is almost the same as the deaths per 100 cases. This shows that the recoveries is almost as many as confirmed cases. Hopefully, with sustained precaution, we may be able to further control the outbreak of this virus.</p>
